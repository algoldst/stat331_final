[J]**Is there a correlation between threat level & race?**

If so, possible sources might be:

- Interactions with police among specific racial groups might, on average, be more aggressive / carry higher risk

- Police perception of an individual’s threat level might be influenced/biased by race.

- How does city population factor into the number of police shootings? What about population densities? Are these correlated?
